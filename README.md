## Abstract
This smart garden system uses a wireless sensor network to monitor and control environmental conditions, creating optimal conditions for plant growth. The system includes DHT22 sensors to measure temperature and humidity, BH1750 to measure light intensity, and soil moisture sensors to collect real-time data from the plant's surroundings. Sensor data collected and processed by the Arduino is then transmitted to the Raspberry Pi 4, where it is stored on the Firebase cloud storage service and displayed on websites and mobile apps built with FastAPIs.
